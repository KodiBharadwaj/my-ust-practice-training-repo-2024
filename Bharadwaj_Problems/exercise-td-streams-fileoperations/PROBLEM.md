## Problem Statement: Given file is read and the content present inside is manipulated

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, given file is read and the content present inside is manipulated
      
       Should read the content from the file if it exists
       Should return the count of unique words
       Should return the set of unique words
       Should return the list of words in uppercase excluding the first line
       Should return a string which has each word separated by colon
       Should return a string which has each line separated by comma
       Should return the maximum of the integers if present 
       Should return the sum of the integers if present
       `sample.txt` file is provided in the root path for the data to be read
      
**Note: Use Streams,Collectors and Pattern class.Use flatMap and reduce methods wherever possible**  
   
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
